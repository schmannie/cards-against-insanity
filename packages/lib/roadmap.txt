+ Lib

What's the strategy?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to eliminate duplicate structures and types on both `client` and
`server` by building them in this `lib` package.

Minimize adding code to lib that only runs on one-side. Ideally,
everything in `lib` should be used on both `client` and `server`.
